# Just fukin give it some time !

I think not everything needs to happen quickly in your life. It's okay if things take time. Just because someone gets everything in life on time doesn't mean they are happy.

It's okay if you don't have a girlfriend in your 20s. Maybe now you have some more me time to experiment and do stupid stuff, and maybe you can master living alone. You may be more mature when things happen to you, or you can also be stupid.

Everything in life needs time, and comparing it with others doesn't make sense. Also, you have to remember the fact that there is always something better out there (like Thalaivar said). So don't chase for better , chase for what you want. I am happy with dosa, so why do I need something better to replace it? And by the way, nothing can replace dosa.

So what I am saying to myself is just fucking give it some time, man!
