# India is not poor , its just the Economics works different 


Before starting this, I am not a financial expert. This is just my opinion.

So recently I came to know that the GDP of my state Tamil Nadu and some other southern states is almost equal to Vietnam—not just GDP, but also the GDP per capita income. But when you calculate this for whole India, it drags us down, which often portrays us as poor compared to other countries in SEA. This seems to be crazy. Why is that?

I say India's diversity is a gift as well as a curse. If you check the population of India, most is from some northern states, and unfortunately these states are poor. The per capita income is way less. So this is one of the key facts why India is always lagging in all metrics which are widely accepted by the rest of the countries in the world.

Personally, it seems to be unfair as someone from Tamil Nadu—a state which is performing really well even after all the corruption and poor governance—and we are still seen as poor just because some regions are not making it up.

So I think it's time for Tamil Nadu and Tamils to go global and promote ourselves, but this will never happen unless we solve cheap politics.
