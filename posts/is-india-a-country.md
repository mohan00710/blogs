# Is India a country?

## The answer is: it is—and it isn’t.

It’s a country on paper, but in reality, it’s very different. What I would call it is an artificial country that was born out of British colonization. If it weren’t for the British, I don’t think there would be an India as we know it today.

India is so diverse that I need a translator to understand what my Prime Minister is saying. My neighboring state, Kerala, is run by communists and unlike other communist nations, they have proper democratic elections.

## So why is this a problem?

With this structure, development becomes very hard. The priorities of people from different regions are different. Their cultures are different. And the biggest problem is generalization and stereotypes.

For example, as someone from South India, Tamil Nadu, I have no idea about many of the stereotypes people talk about because most of them point to the North. These days, especially foreigners, say things like “Indians do this,” “Indians do that,” or “This is how it’s done in India.” But when you check the video, it’s usually from Delhi or Mumbai.

How is someone in Chennai, Kochi, or Kanyakumari supposed to be the same when they have a completely different culture?

One more thing I’ve noticed recently: when people experience something bad in Delhi or Mumbai, they say, “This is India.” But when they see something good, they rename or rebrand it and never mention that it’s from India.

A good example is Kerala. Recently, I’ve seen many white tourists flocking there it’s an amazing place. (Honestly, I feel ashamed that as a neighbor I’ve never been there… coming soon.) I see them mentioning Kerala and not India, which is actually good in a way because it gives a shoutout to Keralites. But I don’t fully understand this behavior why don’t they say the same when they encounter something bad, instead of spoiling the image of over a billion people?

This is just a thought that was on my mind. Maybe this helps you understand India a little better.

Also, the reason I’ve mentioned Delhi and Mumbai is because most people I’ve met who have traveled to India have only been to these places, and they think that is India. If you check most of the videos shown on social media outside the country, So no offense 😊
